<p>The arrival of over 100,000 migrants has caused commotions in the city of New York over running out of shelters. Thousands of individuals, from all over the world, arrive each week to the most populated city of the United States. Authorities have struggled to provide housing for the influx of people, as it is the city’s legal duty to provide emergency housing to homeless people.</p>

  <p>“It would make more sense to step up real case management and help people move out on whatever timeline is appropriate for them, rather than arbitrarily telling people they need to come back," said Staff Attorney at The Legal Aid Society Josh Goldfein to the Daily News. </p>

<div class="container">
  <p>To allow more migrants to have access to the available shelters, Mayor Eric Adams announced in July that they will implement a restricted time period for migrants to stay at the shelters. The policy will give 30 days for adults to leave the shelters, and 60 days for families.</p>
